# Scouting
The Scouting Program including the Python program and Android Application.

# Note
This repository will host all years variations of the scouting app on seperate branches, as each new year the previous year app will be used as a base. As such it will be easier to track down where potential issue might have been introduced and start creating a strong app base with the knowledge of the previous years.

If spefic change to the app is being made for an off season competition, or some training on scouting system base, then additional branches can be made to house those changes. This will help in the event of some future change to the game resembling an off season change that might have been made previously, allowing us to quickly jump to those changes.
